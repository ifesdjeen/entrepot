# Entrep√¥t, for people who treat their data with care.

Back in Java days, everything was easy: you define a Plain Old Java Object (POJO), fill it up with some data, afterwards you let others fill it up with data.
Filling up with data is strictly a Repository problem, whilst validation and internal conversions are more related to the object itself. Trying to tie
absolutely different data stores into a single interface is a tedious task. Untangle your thoughts and use the idioms that come from your db's world.

That particular project and it's satellite is an attempt to bring at least two data stores together using Veritas.

Gain a full control over your databases and objects, again. Don't let tie your arms.

Entrepot is similar to "Curator":(https://github.com/braintree/curator) in many ways

# Disclaimer

You may feel or may not feel the same problem. If you have a form with an ability to manipulate nested embedded fields without headache, validate in a way that
is absolutely not related to persisting, you have found a friend.
